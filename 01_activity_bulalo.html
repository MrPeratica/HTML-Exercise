                            <p>
                                 Still clinging to the last vestiges of spring and the unusually cool weather we’ve been having, I wanted to break out my pressure cooker for one last hurrah before summer fully sets in. This dish comes from a country where the average temperature rarely falls below 80 degrees, making Bulalo a filling stew that’s deceptively light. Perfect, even in warmer weather.

                                Native to the Southern Luzon region of the Philippines, Bulalo is a light colored soup that’s made rich by cooking beef shanks and beef marrow bones for hours, until much of the collagen and fat has melted into the clear broth. The seasonings vary from chef to chef with some using only salt and black pepper while other variations call for patis, bay leaves or even garlic. But at its core, Bulalo a simple cattleman’s stew, best made in a large cauldron with whatever veggies are growing near by.

                                In that respect, it’s actually quite similar to the Mexican beef stew, Caldo de Res, which is not entirely surprising given the 250 years of trade that occurred between the two countries while under Spanish rule.

         <li>Step 1

            Begin by getting a large pot and filling it with water. Let the water boil together with the beef shanks and onions. Let it simmer for 1.5 hours or until beef is tender. Remember to remove the scum from the surface of the water every now and then, to ensure your soup will be nice and clear.</li>
         <li>Step 2

            Now drop in the Knorr Beef Cubes, corn and sliced saba.</li>
         <li>Step 3
            Mix in baguio beans and pechay and just simmer for a minute.</li>
         <li>Step 4
            Give this soup a nice seasoning of pepper and that's our dish! Just like mom, a big serving of Bulalo is enough to fill your day with good thoughts and warm hugs.
